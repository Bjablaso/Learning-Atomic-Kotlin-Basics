# Learning-Atomic-Kotlin-Basics
This repository showcases my journey of learning Kotlin for Android development. I start with basic programming concepts,
then explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), usability, functional programming, and error handling. Later 
I dive into advanced tools, frameworks, and best practices to enhance my Kotlin skills.

- ### Basic
  -  VariableAndStandardOutPut: 
       The Kotlin code demonstrates the concepts of variables, including mutable (var) and immutable (val) variables, and explains variable declaration and initialization. It highlights string interpolation using $, performing calculations within strings, and manipulating lists while emphasizing the distinction between immutable objects and mutable states. Additionally, it introduces the const keyword for creating compile-time constants and clarifies that val variables holding objects can have their state modified but cannot be reassigned to new instances.
